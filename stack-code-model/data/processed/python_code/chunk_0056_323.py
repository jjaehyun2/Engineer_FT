	* Allows an Apple account that has GameCenter to be used as an authentication mechanism.
	* The request must supply the GameCenter user details, such as the player id and username.
	* If the GameCenter user is already linked to a player, the current session will switch to the linked player.
	* If the current player has previously created an account using either DeviceAuthentictionRequest or RegistrationRequest AND the GameCenter user is not already registered with the game, the GameCenter user will be linked to the current player.
	* If the current player has not authenticated and the GameCenter user is not known, a new player will be created using the GameCenter details and the session will be authenticated against the new player.
	* If the GameCenter user is already known, the session will switch to being the previously created user.
	* This API call requires the output details from GKLocalPlayer.generateIdentityVerificationSignatureWithCompletionHandler on your iOS device
