     * What the hell, dint I just say that I am using the Resize event to align Camera Preview
     * orientation with that of screen? Why am I handling Orientation Change again then?
     * Well I wish things were simpler, but read on...
     *
     * Problems:
     * 1. Stage_Orientation_Change event is fired regardless of the stage orientation change, WTF?
     * Yes, its actually a device orientation than a stage orientation. Eg. Many Mobile Phones
     * Do not support UPSIDE_DOWN orientation, in such case your stage will remain in landscape
     * (or whatever it was bfore you turned your device UPSIDE_DOWN) but you will still get
     * Stage Orientation Change Event, and you will end up seeing wrong things on screen.
     *
     *  Ok So, isn't this the reason we used resize event to avoid issue? Yes, But now
     *  its time for Resize event behaviour.
     *
     *  2. Resize, Event is not fired when you move from landscape to landscape
     *  (Eg. rotatedLeft to rotatedRight) or from portrait to portrait(Makes sense because
     *  stage size is not changing its just rotating). Combine this behaviour with (1),
     *  when you move your phone(which doesn't have Upside_Down by default ^^ )
     *  In all orientations clockwise you essentially move your stage from landscape to
     *  landscape (because there is not upside down)
     *
     *  Hence in the (Device) Orientation Change event, I see if we are moving from
     *  same aspectRatio to same aspectRatio(portrait) and call resize functionality manually
     *  to bring the Camera Preview Orientation in sync with the stage.
     *
     *  ^^ In Native Android you can force reverse Orientation support by using screenOrientation
     *  Activity Manifest attribute, as mentioned at
     *  http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#screen . but in AIR
     *  it seems to be a reserved attribute as per
     *  http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WSfffb011ac560372f-5d0f4f25128cc9cd0cb-7ffc.html#WS2d929364fa0b8137-456dc20c12a43aefb00-8000
