*&  Observable is the interface that our Quackables should
*&  implement if they want to be observed.
*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
INTERFACE lif_observable.
  METHODS description RETURNING VALUE(rv_text) TYPE string.
  " It has an ABAP event for notifying the observers.
  EVENTS notify_observers.

  METHODS update

*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
*&  ยง15) Now, we need to make sure all the concrete classes that
