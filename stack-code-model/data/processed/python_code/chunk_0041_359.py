	* If the current player has previously created an account using either DeviceAuthentictionRequest or RegistrationRequest AND the Kongregate user is not already registered with the game, the Kongregate user will be linked to the current player.
	* If the current player has not authenticated and the Kongregate user is not known, a new player will be created using the Kongregate details and the session will be authenticated against the new player.
	* If the Kongregate user is already known, the session will switch to being the previously created user.
