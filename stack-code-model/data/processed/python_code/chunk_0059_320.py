/**
 * The <code>IProcess</code> interface provides a common interface for the 
 * execution of synchronous or asynchronous tasks. It is mostly used for 
 * asynchronous tasks.
 *
 * <p>Synchronous tasks are directly done in the <code>start</code> method 
 * and are finished when the <code>start</code> method returns.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Asynchronous tasks are only started in the <code>start</code> method and 
 * are finished some time after the <code>start</code> method returns. 
 * An asynchronous task is for example loading a file or getting data from a 
 * web service (which cannot be done synchronously in ActionScript). 
 * You may also use asynchronous processes to do a huge computation 
 * step-by-step which would crash the flash player or would prevent user
 * interaction if done synchronously.</p>
