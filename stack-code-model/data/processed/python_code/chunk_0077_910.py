/**
 * Encapsulates the code for bracketing transactions on an arbitrary collection of clients. An
 * instance of this class is used by the AVRG server agent to implement the <code>doBatch</code>
 * API call. This may become important for AVRGs, particularly their server agents, to overcome the
 * message rate limit. The means of starting and committing transactions is to use the methods in
 * <code>InvocationDirector</code>. Therefore the technique only actually batches invocation
 * requests, not <code>DObject</code> activity.
 *
 * <p>Note that using <code>InvocationDirector</code> transactions in no way affects the number of
 * outgoing messages on the server. Therefore this is an incomplete solution and extensive work
 * will be needed on the client and server in order to remove the potential risk of a large number
 * of outgoing messages from the server as a result of a small number of incoming message from the
 * AVRG.</p>
