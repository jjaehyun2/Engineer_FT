     * Specifies whether to use FIRTimestamps for timestamp fields in FIRDocumentSnapshots. This is
     * now enabled by default and should not be disabled.
     *
     * Previously, Firestore returned timestamp fields as NSDate but NSDate is implemented as a double
     * which loses precision and causes unexpected behavior when using a timestamp from a snapshot as a
     * part of a subsequent query.
     *
     * So now Firestore returns FIRTimestamp values instead of NSDate, avoiding this kind of problem.
     *
     * To opt into the old behavior of returning NSDate objects, you can temporarily set
     * areTimestampsInSnapshotsEnabled to false.
     *
     * @deprecated This setting now defaults to true and will be removed in a future release. If you are
     * already setting it to true, just remove the setting. If you are setting it to false, you should
     * update your code to expect FIRTimestamp objects instead of NSDate and then remove the setting.
