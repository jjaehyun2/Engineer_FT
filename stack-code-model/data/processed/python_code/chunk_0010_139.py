      " want our subclasses to be able to override this method and
      " change the recipe! We've also generalized steps 2 and 4 to
      " brew() the beverage and to add_condiments().

      " Rememeber, we moved these into the Caffeine Beverage class.
      boil_water, pour_in_cup,

    " algorithm for making caffeinated beverages.
