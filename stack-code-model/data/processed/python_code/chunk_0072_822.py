		/**
		 * Registers an event listener object with an EventDispatcher object so that the listener 
		 * receives notification of an event. You can register event listeners on all nodes in the 
		 * display list for a specific type of event, phase, and priority.After you successfully register an event listener, you cannot change its priority
		 * through additional calls to addEventListener(). To change a listener's
		 * priority, you must first call removeListener(). Then you can register the
		 * listener again with the new priority level. Keep in mind that after the listener is registered, subsequent calls to
		 * addEventListener() with a different type or
		 * useCapture value result in the creation of a separate listener registration. 
		 * For example, if you first register a listener with useCapture set to 
		 * true, it listens only during the capture phase. If you call 
		 * addEventListener() again using the same listener object, but with
		 * useCapture set to false, you have two separate listeners: one
		 * that listens during the capture phase and another that listens during the target and
		 * bubbling phases.You cannot register an event listener for only the target phase or the bubbling 
		 * phase. Those phases are coupled during registration because bubbling 
		 * applies only to the ancestors of the target node.If you no longer need an event listener, remove it by calling 
		 * removeEventListener(), or memory problems could result. Event listeners are not automatically
		 * removed from memory because the garbage
		 * collector does not remove the listener as long as the dispatching object exists (unless the useWeakReference
		 * parameter is set to true).Copying an EventDispatcher instance does not copy the event listeners attached to it. 
		 * (If your newly created node needs an event listener, you must attach the listener after
		 * creating the node.) However, if you move an EventDispatcher instance, the event listeners 
		 * attached to it move along with it.If the event listener is being registered on a node while an event is being processed
		 * on this node, the event listener is not triggered during the current phase but can be 
		 * triggered during a later phase in the event flow, such as the bubbling phase.If an event listener is removed from a node while an event is being processed on the node,
		 * it is still triggered by the current actions. After it is removed, the event listener is
		 * never invoked again (unless registered again for future processing).
		 * @param	type	The type of event.
		 * @param	listener	The listener function that processes the event. This function must accept
		 *   an Event object as its only parameter and must return nothing, as this example shows:
		 *   <codeblock>
		 *   function(evt:Event):void
		 *   </codeblock>
		 *   The function can have any name.
		 * @param	useCapture	Determines whether the listener works in the capture phase or the 
		 *   target and bubbling phases. If useCapture is set to true, 
		 *   the listener processes the event only during the capture phase and not in the 
		 *   target or bubbling phase. If useCapture is false, the
		 *   listener processes the event only during the target or bubbling phase. To listen for
		 *   the event in all three phases, call addEventListener twice, once with 
		 *   useCapture set to true, then again with
		 *   useCapture set to false.
		 * @param	priority	The priority level of the event listener. The priority is designated by
		 *   a signed 32-bit integer. The higher the number, the higher the priority. All listeners
		 *   with priority n are processed before listeners of priority n-1. If two
		 *   or more listeners share the same priority, they are processed in the order in which they
		 *   were added. The default priority is 0.
		 * @param	useWeakReference	Determines whether the reference to the listener is strong or
		 *   weak. A strong reference (the default) prevents your listener from being garbage-collected.
		 *   A weak reference does not. Class-level member functions are not subject to garbage 
		 *   collection, so you can set useWeakReference to true for 
		 *   class-level member functions without subjecting them to garbage collection. If you set
		 *   useWeakReference to true for a listener that is a nested inner 
		 *   function, the function will be garbage-collected and no longer persistent. If you create 
		 *   references to the inner function (save it in another variable) then it is not 
		 *   garbage-collected and stays persistent.
		 * @langversion	3.0
		 * @playerversion	Flash 9
		 * @playerversion	Lite 4
		 * @throws	ArgumentError The listener specified is not a function.
