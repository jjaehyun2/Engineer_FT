* 
* You can get a parameter by using evt.getParam(paramName)
* You can get an object by using evt.getObject(objName)

* the "userJoin" event sends these arguments:
* 
* zone (param)  .... name of the zone where the event occurred
* user (object) .... User object representing the user that joined
* 
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The User Object:
* 
* the User class represents a client logged in the server.
* Here are some of the methods you can call on these objects:
* 
* getName()		returns the name of the client
* getUserId()		returns the unique client ID
* getPlayerIndex()	returns the automatically assigned player index.
* 			Player index tells what player number is the selected client.
* 			if a playerIndex == -1, the client is a spectator, not a player.
