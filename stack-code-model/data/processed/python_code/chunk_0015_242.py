"! This class implements the builder pattern for zcl_car
"!
"! A builder encapsulates complex instaniation logic of
"! another class. It makes coping with different configurations
"! of a class easy where normally a lot of optional constructor
"! parameters would be used the builder can provide separate methods
"! for parameters or one method per configuration of parameters
"! (the latter one is not implemented here). In this implementation
"! I choose to automatically fill not passed parameters. This is not
"! part of the pattern but a adaption I made.
