     * Enables the use of FIRTimestamps for timestamp fields in FIRDocumentSnapshots.
     *
     * Currently, Firestore returns timestamp fields as an NSDate but NSDate is implemented as a double
     * which loses precision and causes unexpected behavior when using a timestamp from a snapshot as
     * a part of a subsequent query.
     *
     * Setting timestampsInSnapshotsEnabled to true will cause Firestore to return FIRTimestamp values
     * instead of NSDate, avoiding this kind of problem. To make this work you must also change any code
     * that uses NSDate to use FIRTimestamp instead.
     *
     * NOTE: in the future timestampsInSnapshotsEnabled = true will become the default and this option
     * will be removed so you should change your code to use FIRTimestamp now and opt-in to this new
     * behavior as soon as you can.
