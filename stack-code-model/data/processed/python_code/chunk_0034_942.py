 * Enumerates the ways in which the flash client can be embedded. Traditionally this is either "on
 * whirled.com" or not. This class was added to also incorporate the notion of being embedded on
 * Facebook. The behavior in this scenario overlaps partially with traditional embeds and
 * partially with whirled.com. As much as possible, individual methods define the specific
 * categories of overlapping behavior.
 *
 * <p>Note that the gwt Embedding enumeration is a nested class in <code>client.frame.Frame</code>.
 * The value does not need to be serialized (so class names don't have to match). Furthermore, they
 * are not exactly analogous because gwt is never embedded independently like the flash client (it
 * does not make sense to include the <code>OTHER</code> value there).</p>
