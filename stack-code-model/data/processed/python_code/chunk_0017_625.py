* This is an attempt to recreate the "all pairs" algorithim in ABAP
* I have the source code of a program in PEARL to do this, but it is
* much more fun to re-invent the wheel
* The idea is as follows:-
* You populate a speadsheet with two columns
* In the first are the variable names
* For each variable there are multiple rows with the different possible
* values in the second column
* You upload this, and the minimum possible number of test cases to
* get full coverage are calculated, and displayed via the ALV
* You can then download the test cases to another spreadsheet and use
* that to populate the ZMOCKUP_LOADER (after adding in expected results)
* Hey Presto! The program with all the different variables wll use the
* ZMOCKUP_LOADER to loop through the test cases and Uncle Bob is your Uncle
