	/**
	 * The Video class displays live or recorded video in an application 
	 * without embedding the video in your SWF file.  
	 * This class creates a Video object that plays 
	 * either of the following kinds of video: recorded video files stored on a server or locally,
	 * or live video captured by the user. 
	 * A Video object is a display object on the application's display list and represents
	 * the visual space in which the video runs in a user interface.
	 * 
	 *   <p class="- topic/p ">
	 * When used with Flash Media Server, the Video object allows you to
	 * send live video captured by a user to the server and then
	 * broadcast it from the server to other users.
	 * Using these features, you can develop media applications such as
	 * a simple video player, a video player with multipoint publishing from
	 * one server to another, or a video sharing application for a user community.
	 * </p><p class="- topic/p ">
	 * Flash Player 9 and later supports publishing and playback of FLV files encoded 
	 * with either the Sorenson Spark or On2 VP6 codec and also supports an alpha channel. The On2 
	 * VP6 video codec uses less bandwidth than older technologies and offers additional deblocking 
	 * and deringing filters. See the flash.net.NetStream class for more information about video playback and supported 
	 * formats.</p><p class="- topic/p ">
	 * Flash Player 9.0.115.0 and later supports mipmapping to optimize runtime rendering quality and performance. 
	 * For video playback, Flash Player uses mipmapping optimization if you set the Video object's <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">smoothing</codeph>
	 * property to <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">true</codeph>. 
	 * </p><p class="- topic/p ">
	 * As with other display objects on the display list,
	 * you can control various properties of Video objects. For example,
	 * you can move the Video object around on the Stage by using its <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">x</codeph> and
	 * <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">y</codeph> properties, you can change its size using its <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">height</codeph>
	 * and <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">width</codeph> properties, and so on. 
	 * </p><p class="- topic/p ">
	 * To play a video stream, use <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">attachCamera()</codeph> or <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">attachNetStream()</codeph>
	 * to attach the video to the Video object. Then, add the Video object
	 * to the display list using <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">addChild()</codeph>.
	 * </p><p class="- topic/p ">
	 * If you are using Flash Professional, you can also place the Video object on the Stage
	 * rather than adding it with <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">addChild()</codeph>, like this:
	 * </p><ol class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li ">If the Library panel isn't visible, select Window &gt; Library to display it.</li><li class="- topic/li ">Add an embedded Video object to the library by clicking the Options menu on
	 * the right side of the Library panel title bar and selecting New Video.</li><li class="- topic/li ">In the Video Properties dialog box, name the embedded Video object for use in the library
	 * and click OK.</li><li class="- topic/li ">Drag the Video object to the Stage and use the Property Inspector to give it
	 * a unique instance name, such as <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">my_video</codeph>.(Do not name it Video.)</li></ol><p class="- topic/p ">In AIR applications on the desktop, playing video in fullscreen mode disables any power and screen saving
	 * features(when allowed by the operating system).</p><p class="- topic/p "><b class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ">Note:</b> 
	 * The Video class is not a subclass of the InteractiveObject class, so
	 * it cannot dispatch mouse events. However, you can call the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">addEventListener()</codeph> method
	 * on the display object container that contains the Video object.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 *   EXAMPLE:
	 * 
	 *   The following example uses a Video object with the NetConnection and 
	 * NetStream classes to load and play an FLV file. To run this example, you need an FLV file 
	 * whose name and location match the variable passed to <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">videoURL</codeph>, 
	 * in this case, an FLV file called Video.flv that is in the same directory as the SWF file.
	 * <p class="- topic/p ">In this example, the code that creates the Video and NetStream objects and calls
	 * <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">Video.attachNetStream()</codeph> and <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">NetStream.play()</codeph> is placed 
	 * in a handler function. The handler is called only if the
	 * attempt to connect to the NetConnection object is successful, which is 
	 * when the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">netStatus</codeph> event returns an info object with a <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">code</codeph>
	 * property that indicates success. 
	 * It is recommended that you wait for a successful connection before calling 
	 * <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">NetStream.play()</codeph>. </p><codeblock xml:space="preserve" class="+ topic/pre pr-d/codeblock ">

		 * In addition, a deringing filter is available when you use the On2 VP6 codec.
