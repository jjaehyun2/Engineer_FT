For instance, only kids and young adults are allowed in school, while only adults can get married and have children.<br><br><b>Title</b><br>Title can be either \'Head of Family\', \'Spouse\' (of the head of the family) or \'Family Member\'.<br><br><b>Education</b><br>The amount of years each family member has spent in school is displayed here. Higher education means a better job offers and marriage proposals if the person leaves the farm, but also increases farm work efficiency.<br><br><b>Fertile</b><br>Once family members reach maturity, they become fertile. Fertility may be lost due to natural ageing, or if health drops very low.<br><br><b>Workload</b><br>A number indicating the family member\'s capacity for and efficiency at farm work. The higher the number, the more will be earned on crops and livestock. Workload is affected both by the family member\'s age, health and educational level, as well as by what other activites the person has chosen for the year, such as going to school or becoming pregnant. Infants have negative workload scores, because they require attention more than they contribute to farm work. Sending kids to school early on is a good way of raising their work proficiency above the default value of 75 held by adults at full health.<br><br><b>Health</b><br>The persons health, ranging from 0 to 100. If health drops to 0, the person dies. Each year, there\'s a risk that each person loses a little health due to common diseases and accidents. Years of drought and famine are especially dangerous to family health in this respect. Health levels can be restored by paying for medical treatment.<br><br><b>Married to</b><br>If the family member is married, the name of the spouse is displayed here.<br><br><br><b>Actions</b>&help6=<b>Give Medicine</b><br>This option will be available for family members whose health has dropped below 100, if there\'s enough money for treatment. Medical treatment and medicine can be purchased 1) For the entire family at once, 2)To fully restore the health of the selected family member, or 3) One health-point at a time for the selected family member. Prices are halved if the Clinic improvement has been built.<br><br><b>Have Baby</b><br>Option available to fertile women who are either the head of the family, or spouse to the head of the family. A pregnancy lowers the woman\'s work efficiency that year.<br><br><b>Marriage</b><br> Marriage becomes available as a an option when family members reach the age of 18. If a spouse is found, a bride gift is estimated depending on various factors, such as health, age and educational level of the family member to be wed. Proposals can then be accepted or rejected. If the head of the family marries, the new spouse moves to the farm and becomes a member of the family. When anybody else marries, they leave the farm to go and live with the new spouse elsewhere.<br><br><b>Go To School</b><br>Sending kids to school is the best way to prepare them for life. For a fee, each kid can be sent to school every turn. While in school, they cannot contribute much to farmwork, but they will learn skills that make them more efficient later in life. Building the School improvement makes fees cheaper, and allows kids to contribute more to work at the farm since they don\'t have to travel very far to school every day.<br><br><b>Family Head</b><br>basically it doesnt matter as long as someone is over eight years od<br><br><b>leave fam</b><br>basically if i leave u get a bit of moneys and if im head of fam then someone else will be and if they are under eight then that bad someone must be older than eight or we die.<br><br>bad luck!&creditsTextLang=credit<br><br>first World Farmer Team<br>* alex h<br>* alex h<br>* alex h<br>* jean du<br>* jean du<br><br>thanks for playing this mod by alex h and jean du lol xd this was bad right :D&bMoreGame=More Games";
