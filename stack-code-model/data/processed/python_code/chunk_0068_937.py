   // This class implements the GUI aspect of our Cyclopath items. Only two
   // types of Items use sprites: Geofeatures and Tiles.
   //
   // NOTE: I [lb] thought about implementing event listeners for mouse events,
   //       but this seems unnecessarily complex without a positive benefit.
   //       Firstly, the map canvas already knows about this class, so who
   //       cares if it already knows about the item classes (i.e., who cares
   //       about coupling). Secondly, this adds overhead to the system,
   //       because every Item_Sprite would have to register one or more event
   //       listeners (though I'm not sure the memory or resource usage would
   //       actually be detectable). Thirdly, while the map gets a MouseEvent,
   //       we'd have to create a new Event of our own, which adds complexity
   //       to an already complex system.
   //
   //       If you want to know more, see "Manually dispatching events":
