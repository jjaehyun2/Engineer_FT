It works by recursively dividing the array into halves until each sub-array contains only one element (which is inherently sorted). Then it merges these sorted sub-arrays back together to form increasingly larger sorted arrays.\n\nThe code consists of two functions:\n\n1. `merge_sort(arr)`: The main recursive function that:\n   - Checks if the array has 0 or 1 elements (base case) and returns it if true\n   - Otherwise, divides the array into left and right halves\n   - Recursively calls itself on both halves to sort them\n   - Calls the merge function to combine the sorted halves\n\n2. `merge(left, right)`: Combines two sorted arrays into one sorted array by:\n   - Creating an empty result array\n   - Comparing elements from both arrays and adding the smaller one to the result\n   - Once one array is exhausted, adding all remaining elements from the other array\n\nThe time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n) in all cases, making it more efficient than simpler algorithms like bubble sort or insertion sort for large datasets. However, it requires O(n) additional space for the merging process.", "category": "code_explanation", "language": "python", "source": "gpt4_generated"}
